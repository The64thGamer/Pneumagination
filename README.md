_**Pneumagination**_ is an open source sandbox game focused on automating goods production and entertainment through a simple node-based system. Players craft resources, build, and attract people to trade during the day. The night brings forth dangers from the dark, with a rare chance some creatures may want to purchase your wares with exotic goods. Advance your technology to enhance the trading experience and automate your builds as you construct across the land, and eventually towards new horizons.
