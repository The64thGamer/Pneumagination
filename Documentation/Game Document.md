**_Pneumagination_** is a sandbox automation game focusing on creating useful items, food, and entertainment for your community using a node-based power network.

## Game Feel (Economy)
(A headspace for how the game should feel when starting and progressing into learning the core mechanics)

As a player you are spawned in a small space with a lemon tree and a table with an item board on it. Random NPCs will occasionally walk up to the table, and then walk away. The player soon finds they can grab dropped lemon from the tree and place it on the item board. NPCs will then take the lemon and trade it for rocks.

Using the rock, you can chop down the lemon tree for wood, alongside it giving you two saplings to replant. Now with wood and rocks, the crafting table opens up to its first selection of things: Wood tables, wood item boards (so you can trade more lemon at a time), decor, a crank, and a food masher!

Crafting the food masher, it doesn't do anything! Looking like it needs an input, you craft the crank. A new menu appears, being the node-graph. You can connect the crank as a power source to the masher in the node-graph and begin physically using the crank to generate power.

Throwing a lemon into the masher and using the crank produces lemonade! Placing this onto the item board (yes it magically gets a wooden cup for convenience) has NPCs now trading it for more wood and other items!

This is your first "produced" good that took effort. NPCs are willing to give more valuable items depending on the complexity of a produced good, though also provide varying items depending on if its a food, toy, resource, ect, and everyone has different tastes! The amount of goods produced will also attract more NPCs.

At a baseline during a playthrough, NPCs will rarely trade the rarest items from their pools. The rarity proportions change based on satisfaction, which is achieved when releasing a new good, but eventually you'll run out of new goods when grinding for something specific! This is where the early craftable "Free item board" comes in. This gives your items away for free, while boosting customer satisfaction. Either you grind for lots of stuff to be traded in, or give it all away to occasionally get something great!

## Game Feel (Automation)

In the beginning of the game, many things are going to have to be done by hand. Things crafted, goods produced, goods carried to each item board, ect. After selling lemonade however things should begin opening up to the first automatic power generators. These will power single items and much slower than by hand. The game will have a few core items being automated in the beginning like lemons and lemonade, while the player manually crafts more rare items to trade in singles for a reward.

Once the player gets enough resources they'll be able to begin constructing walls and rooms to house their machines and items. Lights for the rooms will run on the same node-graph power system, creating a struggle between using generators for builds or more machinery. The graph will also begin branching into possible complex circuitry to power things. Players could be happy to just use a single switch to turn on the lights, but maybe each room could have its own switch? Maybe there's a master switch for everything? Maybe lights only come on when you come in the room?

If the player pursues circuitry and computers fast, they'll arrive at recordable media. Inputs will be able to be played back or synched with audio and video to create more complex and engaging experiences for NPCs, or to automate very complex systems for goods. This can easily branch into animatronics, where players can set up an entire showroom of custom effects and showtapes. Animatronics will be accessible early on through using hand cranks and camshafts, but will flourish in the mid-game.

## Random Ideas Board

-Incorperate "Oh Funny Horse" side project as a producable item in-game.
-Set all horse related items to be convertable into glue. Doesn't matter if its a wooden horse statue or a plastic horse toy, all horse items become glue. Achievement for crafting the first horse item is "3 Hooves in the Glue Factory" to hint towards crafting glue.
-Animatronics having an incorperated node-graph pneumatics system where air pressure and air left in the tank changes how they move
-A node-graph system for transporting items. Robots automate item transfer by having a storage connected as "input" for them to pick up from, and an "output" storage unit they have to travel to and drop off. Maybe in the end-game some sort of instant item transfer too.
